Hi! I’m Evgenii, a passionate IT enthusiast with a unique background spanning finance, economics, and now the world of technology. 
My journey is one of constant growth, where perseverance and curiosity drive me to master new skills and discover innovative solutions.  

📌 Key Competencies  
- Adaptability & Multitasking: 15+ years in commerce, including roles as a Chief Accountant, taught me to see the big picture, manage data, and switch seamlessly between tasks. Now, I apply these skills to IT, where structure and analytical thinking are key.  
- Business Logic + IT: My insider understanding of corporate operations fuels my drive to build tech solutions for real-world challenges — automation, analytics, or something entirely groundbreaking.  
- Backend Development: Specializing in C#/.NET, Python/Django, C++, SQL databases, UML, DevOps, API. Focused on writing maintainable code, optimizing performance, and designing scalable architectures.   
- Learning in Depth: Diving deep into backend fundamentals — algorithms, system design, DevOps (Docker, CI/CD), and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure) to create solutions that last.
